# CUE-after-fire
Calculating substrate-specific carbon use efficiency for soil microbial communities following laboratory burn simulations

All code run using R version 4.4.0

clean-up-COIL-data.R   :R script that takes as as input IRMS measurements of carbon concentration and isotopic signature from blanks, standards, and samples and creates a clean output for sample C concentration and isotopic signature. 

processing-Picarro-data.R   :R script that takes as input Picarro gas analyzer measurements of carbon concentration and isotopic signature from blanks, standards, and samples and calculates mg C respired

calculating-CUE.R   :R script that calculates SOC-derived MBC, substrate-derived MBC, SOC-derived CO2, substrate-derived CO2, and CUE
